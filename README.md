## Dependency Assumptions

I've assumed that the following are ok based on the tech task:

**Kotlin Standard Library:** Since the test specifically asks for Kotlin, use of Coroutines for
background threading and Flow for data streams should be allowed.

**Jetpack Compose:** This is explicitly requested in the requirements.

**AndroidX/Jetpack Libraries:** Standard Google-maintained libraries like ViewModel,
Navigation-Compose, and Room (for the required data persistence) as they are part of the modern
official Android toolset.
